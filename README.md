## Scala99 solutions

This project contains my attempts at solving the scala 99 problems from [http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/](http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/),  as well as trials of the official solutions.

Some of my versions aren't exactly elegant - tidying up is left as an exercise for myself later on, once I've tackled the majority.
